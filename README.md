# AccessingTheAccessVan

Accessing the Access Van was a project coded at the Wellesley Fall 2016 Hackathon, which focused on "Hacking for Social Good."  In partnership with the Wellesley College Office of Accessibility, our team addressed the office's need to better serve  students at Wellesley College.

Students with injuries or other physical conditions limiting them from walking to class are able to schedule a ride with the Office of Accessibility.  This process required more work than necessary on both ends.  This project allows for a student to request a ride the night before.  The program then generates a chart to organize rides needed for the day for a van driver.
